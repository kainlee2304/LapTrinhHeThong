# Lecture 01

## Before class:
- I carefully read the course website and syllabus.
- I read chapters 01 and 02 in Stevens.
- I wrote a small hello-world program, debugged the `welcome.c` program, and set up my VM with the suitable compiler flags and aliases.
- I came across this interesting article: [Link to the article](https://some.website.you.found/something-relevant.html)

### Open questions:
- What's the difference between Linux and NetBSD? Aren't both Unix?
- Why are there different sections for the manual pages? What does the "(1)" in "ls(1)" mean?

## After class:
### Important take-aways:
- Always use the right compiler flags (`-Wall -Wextra -Werror`).
- Despite being "Unix-like," Linux and NetBSD are different OSes with different philosophies and licenses.
- I still need to understand the pipeline example from class.
